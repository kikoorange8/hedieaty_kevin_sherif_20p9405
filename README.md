 Hedieaty is a gift list management app designed to streamline the process of creating, managing, and sharing wish lists for special occasions such as birthdays, weddings, engagements, graduations, and holidays. The app features a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily add gifts to their lists, either manually or through an integrated barcode scanner. With Hedieaty, users can manage their lists flexibly, including adding, deleting, and modifying items at any timeâ€”except for items that have been pledged. The app also enables users to publish their lists to the cloud, allowing friends and family to view and pledge to purchase gifts, enhancing the joy of gift-giving. The app should be designed using Flutter and published on Appstore, Google Play Store, and/or Amazon App Store.
